**IntelliMap** is an AI assitant that will help you to sort out what actions should be taken to approach the target outcome from current issue/situation:
  1. Build a basic understanding of your personality with a small questionnaire
  2. Providing recommended actions based on your personality and question description
  3. Predicting possible outcomes based on all your selected actions, question description and any additional details provided.

The AI underlining is _gemini-1.5-flash_

**Implemented by Angular + ASP .NET Core**
